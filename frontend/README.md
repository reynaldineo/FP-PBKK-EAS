## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

It is encouraged to use **pnpm** so the husky hooks can work properly.

pnpm install
```

### 2. Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`.
